//! Banto server: embedded HTTP server for LAN browser access (spec §11).
//!
//! Resource-agnostic infrastructure only: auth/token management, CSRF
//! header enforcement, baseline security response headers, SSE event
//! fan-out, static/SPA fallback serving, and server lifecycle
//! (bind/serve/graceful-shutdown). Anything that knows about a specific
//! resource (`items`, ...) or the frontend build's on-disk location lives
//! in the app crate (`apps/admin-template/core`), which composes these
//! pieces via [`auth::auth_routes`], [`events::sse_route`],
//! [`static_files::static_router`], [`response::ApiError`] and
//! [`security_headers::with_security_headers`].
//!
//! Every router built here stays `Router<()>` (no shared `axum::State`):
//! handlers close over their state (`AuthState`, `broadcast::Sender`, ...)
//! instead, so routers from different modules merge without state-type
//! conflicts.
