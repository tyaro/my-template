/**
 * Public types for @banto/dock-svelte (spec §5). M7 shipped floating pseudo-
 * windows only; M8 Phase A (this file) adds the docked layout tree
 * (spec §5.1: "Panel, Split, TabGroup の再帰的な組み合わせ") as a sibling of
 * `floating` rather than a replacement for it - exactly the forward-compat
 * path the M7 doc comment called out. `version` bumps 1 -> 2 accordingly;
 * `DockState.hydrate` (state.svelte.ts) accepts both shapes, migrating a v1
 * payload to v2 with `docked: null`. z-order is still just array order (last
 * = frontmost) - no numeric z field to keep in sync or serialize.
 *
 * M8 Phase A is the pure data model + tree operations only (core/tree.ts,
 * core/dropzones.ts, and the new DockState methods) - no drag UI, no new
 * .svelte components. Those are Phase B, built on top of this shape.
