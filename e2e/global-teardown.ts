/**
 * Removes the temp SQLite directory playwright.config.ts creates for
 * `BANTO_DB` before each run (`fs.mkdtempSync` under `os.tmpdir()`) - without
 * this, every `pnpm e2e` invocation (locally or in CI) leaves one more
 * `banto-e2e-XXXXXX` directory behind under the OS temp folder forever.
 * `BANTO_E2E_DB_DIR` is set by the config module itself (same process, main
 * config load happens before this runs) rather than passed some other way,
 * since global setup/teardown scripts have no direct handle on the config
 * object's local variables.
